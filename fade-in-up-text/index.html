    <p class="fade-in-up">We were selected by the U.S. Department of Commerce to organize, lead, and manage the Communities of Practice initiative for EDA Revolving Loan Funds.
We expanded our lending products to include a continuum of flexible loans with equity accretion features for businesses of all sizes.
We designed and launched the Supporting Emerging Empowered Developers (SEED) Academy to train BIPOC developers in every aspect of development, including financial training.
We were designated as fund managers of two state business loan programs in Washington and Connecticut.
We continue to be a lending partner in programs in NY, CA, NV, CT, DE, OH, FL, GA, TX, WA, UT, and Metro St Louis.
We expanded our self-directed online professional education programs to offer new classes and certification opportunities to practitioners in the community development industry.</p>
